Second proyect from Soy_Henry Data Science's Bootcamp. Here I use Machine Learning algorithm, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to predict the price of properties in Colombia 2020.

## Using Guide 

The proyect tries to  predict somewhate consistently the price of some properties in Colombia, separated by 0=Cheap or 1=expensive; compared to the median price of all the properties.
The files "solucion.ipynb" and "solucion2.ipynb" present the same solution through KNN but changing some pre-processing methods and also n_neighbors values.

Inside both files there are also multiple commented lines of code of methods and functions inittialy used but subsequently discarded. eachone with his own explanation on why it was discarded and what was pretended to do

solucion.ipynb -----> Recall= 0.9293100085;	 Acuraccy= 0.6370513268\
solucion2.ipynb ----> Recall= 0.9372439357; Acuraccy= 0.6371424665

In each file it's an explanation of each step to follow.

The data used to train and test the algorithm won't be included in this github as well as the data used to show the Colombian map to plot the coordinates; all of this due to a limitation in the upload file size. you can change the file address and names accordingly to what kind of data and maps you get.

execute each line of code in order to watch the procedure. inittialy is feasible that you'll need to pip install some of the imported packages because I didn't make an enviroment


## Roadmap

- Improve the quality of pre-proccessing
- Create the file in a separate enviroment to easily execute it 
- Use of natural language proccessing to collect a lot of data saved in description and title columns
- try new algorithm models more responsive to the type of data
- using geomap  to complete coordinates data instead of imputing the median from other rows
